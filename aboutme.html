		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Liam Ellis is the oldest of four boys. Born in New York City to a Broadway dancing mother and an English teaching father, naturally he'd grow up to juggle a fledgling music career and an expensive academic hobby. Raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Liam embraced the supportive music scene of the small liberal city and landed a publishing contract at Giant Client Publishing with his first band Dandylion Warpaint. As Dandylion Warpaint started to break up, Liam formed his first electronic group Bro Dynasty. After graduating college with a degree in Anthropology, Liam returned to New York City to pursue his music career and work remotely with Bro Dynasty. With an impending financial reality on the horizon and feeling conflicted regarding his musical ambitions, Liam resorted to none other than left field, where he fell in love with computer programming. Drawn by what he considered a left brain approach to creativity, he quickly immersed himself in web development and promptly enrolled at General Assembly. His goal is to be a fullstack developer by March of 2016.</p>
