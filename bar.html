	            <p>You know, when you first start bartending, or first start considering bartending (god, who in their right mind?!), you always hear about the regulars. It’s the “oh the regulars” and “whatta great neighborhood bar” and “oh that’s Jerry, he’s great (he’s not), buy him a drink!” etc. But you know what they don’t actually tell you about bartending? THE. REGULARS. The fleshy, heaving walls of my peopled prison. The prisons a bit more like a hologram, on a reel though, carouseling round and round as the faces get fatter and the drinks stay the same. Like a nauseating time-lapse in poor man’s Nat Geo, if the natives got a hold of the cameras and we became the oohs and ahhs. Anyway, you can’t move. You’re trapped back there and the enemy is advancing. And this time its with this lonely, for no reason I might add - he’s married - older business man, who ostensibly seems like a nice guy, sharp, funny, a little jaded, all good, until and I mean until, even a moderately attractive woman sits at the bar. You’ve seen them, hair, eyes, pulse, the whole 9. Suddenly you’re doing some serious gymnastics to put some social distance between the two of you, like you don’t know his kids names, before you both end up in a scathing editorial in Jezebel, by name ,or some Yelp review that goes viral on the FatJewish. This guy evidently just got off a submarine and this poor girl has no idea she’s lunch. Which brings me to my next point actually. Lunch.</p>

				<p>Let me tell you, there’s nothing quite like the sobering reality of watching your band quarrel over the minute artistic details of a bridge on a B side that no one will hear..because they didn’t even buy your fucking A side. It’s ego masquerading as dedication mostly but its ok because I’m guilty too. Meanwhile, your liberal arts degree, formerly championed as a high-ticket item promising both depth of inquiry and breadth of character with an ample amount of those highly coveted critical thinking skills you keep hearing about begins to wilt a bit as you round the bend on 25 and start revisiting your youthful idealism in light of how good that finance degree….’s girlfriend looks right now, damn. Looks like she needs something (new boyfriend?), oh, wait for it, a Matcha tea latte? Jesus. Oh that’s right, lunch! We were discussing lunch. And she’s ordering a Matcha tea latte like there’s not a PBR sign the size of her sorority’s marquis in the window and so much graffiti on the mirror in the bathroom you can’t even see all the coke on your face. You see, without the sex and the candles and the dim lighting giving everybody a little more credit than they deserve, there’s just something I can’t handle about about that day time bar.</p>

				<p>Let’s say I’m working downtown, let’s say Matcha tea’s older sister comes walking in. She’s pumped. She just got done with her 10:30 yoga  class, went for a quick walk with her girlfriends down to battery park and now they’re bringing the kids in for some lunch. Great. Scene swipe. There I am, making almond milk lattes for this hot robot, and I’m pouring this glass of  OJ that took two hours out of my hangover to juice by hand, for this fucking beautiful bi-racial cumshot who just rolled up in a military grade stroller that cost more than that fucking liberal arts degree I reluctantly mentioned earlier. NAH. Can’t do it. </p>

				<p>In all reality I’m not actually making these drinks anyway because the only way you’d find me at a bar before 7, working nonetheless, is if I crashed there the night before. Who am i kidding, happy hour starts at 5. So, before 5. In all reality its really because I’m actually sitting in front of this sexy as hell MacBook Air, that I might add was produced by a slew of little racials a bit east of here, not much older than that OJ guzzling fetus who insists on ramming his status down my throat. I get it kid, I fucking get it. Now while I'm basking in the luxury of being able to complain about the luxury of others, those nimble little fingers out east keep working away. They make the toys, I make the lattes, OJ and Matcha? They make the money.</p>

				<p>I think that’s the problem with the daytime bar. Its just kind of a sick and very sober window into how the world really works. And its not so much that I even care, I think I’m just good at complaining about it. Blame the degree. But maybe that’s really it, I mean no one knows better than me that I’m a bit jaded maybe even a little bitter, but I do have my tongue planted firmly in my cheek, and that could just be the adderall or maybe I really have found my voice here. BUT Is there really nothing to say when 10’s of thousands of dollars come rolling in on wheels,complete with chauffuers we’re loosely referring to as mothers, turning an establishment that might be halfway vibey, as soon as that fetid city sun goes down and you can’t see how much the staff is sweating, into a fetal parking lot. All the while shouting for whatever detox the hourglass armies of insta are hocking, or whatever Gwenyth Paltrow just ‘grammed. Meanwhile OJ and his squad are getting lit with their faces glued to a $300 iPad because maybe mommy doesn't trust daddy with a real babysitter and god forbid the kids learn to sit still without a barrage of visual stimuli. I mean a full on brigade of children swarming in for brunch with mom served to you on the weary dreams of artists, assholes, and almosts. This my friends is the restaurant industry. Have a seat, your server will be right with you.</p>
