      <p><em class="red">"</em> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age...<em class="red">"</em> <em>H.P.</em></p>

        <p>Liam Ellis is the oldest of four boys. Born in New York City to a Broadway dancing mother and an English teaching father, naturally he'd grow up to juggle a fledgling music career and an expensive academic hobby. Raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Liam embraced the supportive music scene of the small liberal city and landed a publishing contract at Giant Client Publishing with his first band Dandylion Warpaint. As Dandylion Warpaint started to break up, Liam formed his first electronic group Bro Dynasty. After graduating college with a degree in Anthropology, Liam returned to New York City to pursue his music career and work remotely with Bro Dynasty. With an impending financial reality on the horizon and feeling conflicted regarding his musical ambitions, Liam resorted to none other than left field, where he fell in love with computer programming. Drawn by what he considered a left brain approach to creativity, he quickly immersed himself in web development and promptly enrolled at General Assembly. His goal is to be a fullstack developer by March of 2016</p>

              <p>THUMP. Our neighbor's sweaty body collided into our shared apartment wall. Ashy term papers skidded across a wine stained coffee table. "Damn it Joe, turn your bass down." 5 nights a week we played music in an overpriced brownstone in Minneapolis. We dropped out of college, we dropped out of law school, our pants got tighter. Joe just wouldn't turn his bass down.</p>

            <p>Dandylion Warpaint is a five-piece independent band from Minneapolis, MN. Their music displays elements ranging from Rock and Electronic to Jazz and Hip Hop. Individually, each member brings a diverse array of influences that manifest in melody driven, passionate male vocals; harmonically and texturally rich atmospheric synth and keyboards; inspired, effect-driven lead guitar; motivic, jazzy bass grooves; and intricate drums often stylistically guided by electronic influences</p>
